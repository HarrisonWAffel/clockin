# Clock-in
A Golang program that uses the google sheets API to automatically fill out my hours because im too lazy ;)

</br>

## How To Use 

##### Requirements
+ Golang 
+ A Google Account and Google sheet file 
+ A Command Line
+ A credentials file which can be found here : <i><a>https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/go</a></i>


This program takes a single argument, either the character 's', 'i' or 'o'. 

<b>You must first setup the project with your google account and desired google sheet by passing the 's' parameter. </b>

You can then clock in by passing 'i' and can clockout by passing 'o'. You can execute the program with the command "go run main.go" and supplying the required parameters.
